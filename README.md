# 365 Days of Code - 2023

Hi, I’m Eda, passionate about artificial intelligence in healthcare, and healthcare data science.

If you’re the first to come to my page, you might want to check out the [coding challenge](https://github.com/edaaydinea/365-days-of-code-2022) I created last year and progressed on my own.

I plan to improve myself, in the same way, this year, only with a slight difference.

Since I made more progress in the field of coding weekly, I decided to share my posts week by week rather than daily throughout the year.

This year, I aim to bring myself to a proficient level in artificial intelligence for health and to work in this field by combining neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Thanks for visiting!
